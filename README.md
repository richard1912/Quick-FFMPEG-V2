# Quick-FFMPEG-V2



## 🚀 Getting Started with AI-Driven Development

This project is configured for **Spec-Driven Development** using spec-kit and AI coding assistants. Follow these best practices for optimal results:

### 1. Open in AI Coding Environment
- **Cursor** with AI features
- **Claude Code**
- **GitHub Copilot** 
- **VS Code** with AI extensions

### 2. Start with Specification
Use the /specify command to define your project:

`
/specify "Build a [type] application that [main purpose]. Key features include [feature 1], [feature 2], and [feature 3]. The application should [performance/security requirements]."
`

**Best Practices for Specifications:**
- Be specific about the main purpose and target users
- Include key features and functionality requirements
- Mention performance, security, or scalability needs
- Specify the technology stack if you have preferences
- Include any design or UX requirements

### 3. Create Technical Plan
Use the /plan command to develop implementation strategy:

`
/plan "The application will use [tech stack]. Architecture: [frontend/backend structure]. Database: [data storage solution]. Key components: [component 1], [component 2]. Development approach: [methodology]."
`

**Best Practices for Planning:**
- Choose appropriate technology stack
- Define clear architecture and component structure
- Plan data models and API design
- Consider scalability and maintainability
- Break down into manageable phases

### 4. Break Down into Tasks
Use the /tasks command to get actionable development items:

- Review the generated task list
- Prioritize tasks based on dependencies
- Estimate effort for each task
- Assign tasks or work through them systematically

### 5. Implement Features
Use the /implement command to build specific features:

`
/implement specs/001-feature-name/plan.md
`

**Best Practices for Implementation:**
- Work on one feature at a time
- Follow the generated specifications closely
- Test each feature before moving to the next
- Use version control effectively (you're already on develop branch!)

## 🔧 Development Workflow

### Daily Development Process
1. **Start with spec-kit commands** - Define what you're building
2. **Use AI assistance** - Let AI help with implementation details
3. **Test frequently** - Ensure each feature works before proceeding
4. **Commit regularly** - Use push_updates.bat to save progress
5. **Iterate and refine** - Use /specify to update requirements as needed

### Using push_updates.bat
- **Double-click** the file or run from command line
- **Follow prompts** for commit messages
- **Automatic handling** - Git add, commit, and push to develop branch
- **No branch switching needed** - You're already on develop!

### Spec-kit Commands Reference
- /specify "description" - Define project requirements
- /plan "strategy" - Create technical implementation plan  
- /tasks - Generate actionable task list
- /implement specs/XXX-feature/plan.md - Implement specific features

## 🎯 Best Practices for AI Development

### 1. Be Specific and Detailed
- Provide clear, detailed specifications
- Include examples and edge cases
- Specify error handling requirements
- Mention testing and validation needs

### 2. Iterate and Refine
- Start with high-level specifications
- Refine details as you learn more
- Update specifications based on implementation insights
- Use /specify to adjust requirements during development

### 3. Leverage AI Effectively
- Ask for code reviews and improvements
- Request explanations for complex concepts
- Get help with debugging and optimization
- Use AI for documentation and comments

### 4. Maintain Quality
- Test each feature thoroughly
- Follow coding best practices
- Keep code clean and well-documented
- Use version control effectively

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Open this project in your AI coding environment**
2. **Start with /specify** - Define your project requirements
3. **Use /plan** - Create your technical implementation strategy
4. **Run /tasks** - Get your development roadmap
5. **Begin implementation** - Use /implement for each feature
6. **Use push_updates.bat** - Save your progress regularly
